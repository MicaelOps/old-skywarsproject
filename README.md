# old-skywarsproject
This project is from a minecraft minigame called skywars which players have their islands and fight each other.
Well, the project is unfinished, but only missing a few important features like PlayerDeathEvent,Kits,item interaction.

the plugin-core (that contained io.netty and protocolib) only served as a dependency for a network therefore I will not be posting on github. It does not affect this plugin in any way if you remove it.


This is a recovered 2014 project.
